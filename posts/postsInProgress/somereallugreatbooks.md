title: I've read some really great books recently
: 
And I would like to share them! I am almost finished with the Three Body Problem Trilogy and these books have been stuck in my mind. Something about an explainer sci-fi that explores psychology, quantum physics, and aliens really rubs the right parts of my brain.  


Everytime I found myself thinking I might be getting bored, something would be revealed and I would find myself reading 200 more pages instead of doing my work. There's something really comforting about technical details and a confidence in the author to fully deliver a satisfying answer to a mystery.
