- ensuring survey questions are considerate of different abilities and asked appropriately
my question: Are you able to stand for the 30 minute VR session? (if not, a chair will be provided)
chatgpt response: You could phrase it like this: "For the 30-minute VR session, is standing comfortable for you? If not, we're happy to provide a chair for your comfort." This way, you're acknowledging the possibility of discomfort while standing and offering an alternative without assuming anything about the individual's ability.
